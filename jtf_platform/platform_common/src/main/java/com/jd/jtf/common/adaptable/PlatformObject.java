 * An abstract superclass implementing the <code>IAdaptable</code>

 * <p>
 * Note: In situations where it would be awkward to subclass this
 * class, the same effect can be achieved simply by implementing
 * the {@link IAdaptable} interface and explicitly forwarding
 * the <code>getAdapter</code> request to an implementation
 * of the {@link IAdapterManager} service. The method would look like:
 * <pre>
 *     public &lt;T&gt; T getAdapter(Class&lt;T&gt; adapter) {
 *         IAdapterManager manager = ...;//lookup the IAdapterManager service
 *         return manager.getAdapter(this, adapter);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * </p><p>
 * This class can be used without OSGi running.
 * </p><p>
 * Clients may subclass.
